# Max3Sat_Problem
 
Max3Sat – what is this?
• You have n logical variables (true/false or 1/0)


• Variables are grouped in 3-elements clauses, for example:

  𝐶1 = (𝑣1 ∨ ¬𝑣2 ∨ 𝑣3); 𝐶2 = (¬𝑣1 ∨ 𝑣2 ∨ 𝑣4);
  
  𝐶3 = (𝑣1 ∨ 𝑣3 ∨ ¬𝑣4); 𝐶4 = (¬𝑣2 ∨ 𝑣3 ∨ ¬𝑣4);
  
  
• Goal: choose such values of the variables to fullify as much clauses as it is possible.
